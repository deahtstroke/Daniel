				Daniel is a freelance and Backend Engineer based in Roseville with a
				passion for learning new technologies and distributed systems. He has a
				knack for all things that involve Cloud Systems and Distributed
				Services. When not online or reading documentation he loves hanging out
				playing games like Monster Hunter: Wilds, World of Warcraft, or The
				Witcher 3.
			</p>
			<p>
				Daniel's journey on Software Development began on 2017 when he enrolled
				at Community College having no idea that he actually liked what he was
				studying. With each class he took ,the more he realized that he actually
				liked Computer Science as a discipline. Fast-forward to University, in
				his Senior year he began working United Natural Foods (UNFI) a Software
				Engineer 1, balancing both a full-time career and full-time college
				courseload, he quickly made himself acquainted with technical topics
				such as buildin REST APIs, monitoring distributed systems, Cloud
				Deployments via CI/CD pipelines, among other topics.
			</p>
			<p>
				Undeterred by the subsequent layoffs at UNFI, he began to experiment
				with a lot of technologies he found interesting like CI/CD pipelines,
				Reactive Frameworks, and event-driven programming.

		<div class="flex flex-col items-start gap-4">
			<p in:fadeFly={{ delay: fadeCount(), duration: 300, y: 20 }}>
				My journey began in June 2017 when I started community college at Sierra
				College. I declared Computer Science as my major without realizing how
				much I would come to love it. Having spent most of my life around
				computers, I’d always been curious about what was happening “under the
				hood.” As the months went by and I took more classes, I found that
				everything outside of Computer Science felt a bit dull in comparison, a
				subtle but clear sign that my blind-choice was the correct one (thank
				God).
			</p>
			<p in:fadeFly={{ delay: fadeCount(), duration: 300, y: 20 }}>
				After transferring to California State University, Sacramento, I dove
				deeper in my coursework with advanced topics like Database Management
				Systems and Operating Systems, which sparked my interest even further.
				During the summer of my senior year, I landed a full-time offer at UNFI
				as a Software Engineer I. My final semester was a balancing act, working
				full-time while completing my remaining coursework. It was challenging
				for sure, but in December 2022, I proudly graduated with honors with a
				Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
			</p>
			<p in:fadeFly={{ delay: fadeCount(), duration: 300, y: 20 }}>
				After graduation, I continued working at UNFI learning as much as I
				could from my coworkers and mentors, until post-COVID layoffs affected
				my position and those of several colleagues. Although it was a setback,
				the experience had already ignited my curiosity for new technologies and
				concepts that I hadn’t explored in college. I became fascinated by
				distributed systems and cluster workloads. Even the word “cluster” felt
				like a glimpse into something powerful and complex that I had to
				explore. Since then, I’ve focused on deepening my knowledge beyond what
				I learned in school and building projects that are fun, challenging, and
				meaningful to me.
			</p>
			<p in:fadeFly={{ delay: fadeCount(), duration: 300, y: 20 }}>
				Fueled by passion, curiosity, and caffeine, I strive to grow into an
				even better software engineer, collaborate with teams that care deeply
				about what they build, and continue connecting with others who share the
				same drive and enthusiasm for technology.
